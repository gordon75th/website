    <h1 class="letter-title">Happy 4 Months, My Love</h1>
    <p>
      Four months. <br/>
      Just 122 days, and yet, you've changed my entire world.<br/>
      I thought about the day we met today.. Not knowing the story we'd write. You mentioned today that we live in a romance book,
      and maybe we do. But that's how I want to live my life. Every moment perfect, just because I have you. 
      You're the only person that has made me feel special, made me feel loved and deserving of something.
      You made me believe I'm not something to be thrown to the side, and I will always be grateful for that.
      I will always be there for you. No matter how stressed you are because of a Seminar Arbeit. No matter how much you want to cry
      because you're missing me. No matter how annoyed you are at me because I won't stop tickling you. And no matter how ugly, unloved,
      unhappy, not deserving you feel.. I will always be there to let you know that everything about you is perfect. Every imperfection of yours
      is perfect in my eyes. The way that you question perfection is crazy to me... You're perfect to me.
      <br>
      <br>
      Who made you so flawless? I just wish you could for one moment see what I see. Then you would know how shiny your eyes are,
      how beatifuly your hair sits, how amazing every outfit looks, how much your smile shines, how cute your laughter is, how funny
      your jokes are, how uncomparable your voice is, how perfect your body is, how unmatched your personality is, and only then you will know...
      How much I actually love and adore you, Anika.

      <br>
      <br>
      I apologize in advance for writing this much, and I hope you don't cry.. That's the last thing I want. I want to make you feel
      special, loved, deserving. Give you all the attetion and love you give me, and hopefully more. I also apologize for writing in english,
      it's a language I can express myself better in, I'm sowweee... Oh God, I could write for hours about you... You've been the only person so far
      that has made my mind race at 200 km/h but then stop working for minutes on end. You know exactly how to make me forget stuff and personally, sehr frechh duu...

      <br>
      <br>
      I know we said nothing special for 4 months, no gifts blablablaaa.. But I just wanted to get some stuff off of my chest. I miss you so much right now..
      And like we said, there have been days where we've not seen each other for more time, but still...
      The fact that I cant be there to hug you and kiss you on the forehead... And you sending those pictures was also very frechh von dirr.. H√§ttest du noch "imaaaginee du w√§rst da" noch darunterschreiben, nope...
      
      <br>
      <br>
      Damn this got longg.. (hehe, longg)... But I just want to say that I love you more than anything on this world. I apreciate you SOOO MUCH and thank you
      for being in my life, my love.. You have given me the feeling of security, you're my safe space.. Thank God I found a girl, beatuiful and sweet...
      I will never give you up, I hope you never give up on me.. Through hard times, we talk. Through fights we relax and take a breath.
      It's us against the problems, not against each other, meinn bebbiii... 
      
      <br>
      <br>
      You‚Äôre not just my girlfriend...<br/>
      You‚Äôre my person, my sunshine, my poetry. <br/><br/>

      So here's a cringe little attempt at writing something:
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 1.5rem;">
      Roses are red, violets are blue, <br>
    But nothing on Earth is as magical as you. üå∑<br>
    You laugh like sunshine, bright and free,<br>
    And somehow you still choose to love me. <br> <br>

    You sparkle in chaos, you're cute when you're mad, <br>
    You‚Äôre my best decision, life‚Äôs sweetest I‚Äôve had. <br>
    You challenge, you cheer, you make my soul sing, <br>
    With you, even silence feels like spring. <br> <br>

    So here‚Äôs to the giggles, the late-night talks, <br>
    The shared little secrets, the long silly walks. <br>
    Here‚Äôs to your eyes, your heart, your art‚Äî <br>
    I love you, Anika, with all of my heart. üíñ <br>
